Source code for a blog describes how to develop software circuit simulators for scientists and engineers. Engineers use circuit simulator to design the circuit architecture and predict performance before it is committed to hardware reducing rework and cost.  How do circuit simulators work? How can the curious engineer, technician, or hobbyist write a simulator? Although open source simulators exist such as QUCS and Schematic, understanding the software architecture presents a challenge to the occasional programmer. The associate blog closes the learning gap between "Hello World" and a fully operational circuit simulator.
